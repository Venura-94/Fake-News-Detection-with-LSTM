# Project Architecture

## Apply Python Libraries for Data Import and Visualization:

- Utilize Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib/Seaborn for importing datasets and creating visualizations to gain insights into the data.

## Exploratory Data Analysis and Word Cloud Plotting:

- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the structure and characteristics of the dataset.
- Generate word clouds to visualize the frequency of words in the text data.

## Text Data Cleaning:

- Implement text data cleaning techniques such as removing punctuation and stop words to prepare the text data for further analysis.

## Tokenization:

- Gain an understanding of tokenization, the process of breaking text into smaller units (tokens) such as words or subwords.

## Tokenizing and Padding Text Corpus:

- Apply tokenization and padding techniques on the text corpus to prepare the data for feeding into the deep learning model. Tokenization breaks down the text into tokens, while padding ensures that all sequences have the same length.

## Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and LSTM:

- Theory and intuition behind Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, which are commonly used for sequential data processing tasks like text analysis.

## Building and Training the Deep Learning Model:

- Construct a deep learning model, likely using libraries such as TensorFlow, to process the tokenized and padded text data.
- Train the model on the dataset to learn patterns and relationships within the data.

## Assessing Model Performance:

- Evaluate the performance of the trained model using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall,
- Utilize techniques like cross-validation or train-test splits to ensure the model's generalization ability
